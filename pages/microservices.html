<strong>Microservices</strong> - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application
as a collection of services that are

<ul> <li>Highly maintainable and testable</li>
  <li>Loosely coupled</li>
  <li>Independently deployable</li>
  <li>Organized around business capabilities
</li>
<li>Owned by a small team
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:rgb(65, 132, 196);">Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture
</h2>
<p>With monolithic architectures, all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service. This means that if one
process of the application experiences a spike in demand, the entire architecture must be scaled. Adding or improving a
monolithic applicationâ€™s features becomes more complex as the code base grows. This complexity limits experimentation
and makes it difficult to implement new ideas. Monolithic architectures add risk for application availability because
many dependent and tightly coupled processes increase the impact of a single process failure.
</p>
<p>With a microservices architecture, an application is built as independent components that run each application process
as a service. These services communicate via a well-defined interface using lightweight APIs. Services are built for
business capabilities and each service performs a single function. Because they are independently run, each service can
be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application
